- Advanced concepts in RL, Simon Hirländer
- RL in particle accelerator control: are we there yet?, Simon Hirländer

## Python tutorial: reinforcement learning implementation example

- Github repository containing the material: [https://github.com/RL4AA/RL4AA23](https://github.com/RL4AA/RL4AA23)
- Tutorial in slide form: [here](https://rl4aa.github.io/RL4AA23/tutorial.slides.html#/)

## Getting started

- First, download the material to your local disk by cloning the repository:
`git clone https://github.com/ansantam/RL4AA23`
- If you don't have git installed, you can click on the green button that says "Code", and choose to download it as a `.zip` file.

### Setup the environment locally

- Open terminal app
- (Suggested) Create a virtual envrionment using `conda` or `venv`.

#### venv

```bash
python3 -m venv rl4aa
source rl4aa/bin/activate
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
jupyter notebook
```

- Open the tutorial notebook `tutorial.ipynb` in the jupyter server in browser
- When you are done type `deactivate`

#### conda

Instructions to install conda [here](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/4.6.1/user-guide/install/index.html)

```bash
conda create -n rl4aa python=3.10
conda activate rl4aa
cd path_to_your_folder/RL4AA23
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
jupyter notebook
```

- Open the tutorial notebook `tutorial.ipynb` in the jupyter server in browser
- When you are done type `conda deactivate`
